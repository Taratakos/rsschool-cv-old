_Write function calculateTotalPrice(items), which takes an array of prices (numbers) and return their sum_

```
const cart = [54, 28, 105, 70, 92, 17, 120];
// 2 Create a variable total before loop
let total = 0;
// 1 Loop through the array
for (const value of cart) {
  // 3 At each iteration, access the element of the array and add it to the total
  total += value;
}

console.log('Total:', total);

const calculateTotalPrice = function (items) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (const number of items) {
    sum += number;
  }
  return sum;
};

console.log(calculateTotalPrice([54, 28, 105, 70, 92, 17, 120])); // 486
